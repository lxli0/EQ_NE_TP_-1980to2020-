# K–M slope (KMS)

K–M slope (KMS) is a parameter derived from Visiblity Graph Analysis (Lacasa et al., 2008 PNAS; Telesca et al., 2013 Physica A).
We verify that there is a positive between KMS and b-value from Gutenberg–Richter law. Thus, it can be used to estimate b-value.

Here, We provide:

1.  The Matlabcode to calculate KMS_0 (KMS/b ratio) under a given catalog size.

2.  The Matlab code to calculate the temporal evolution of b-value by KMS and the imporved KMS methods. The earthquake data in the 
    northeastern Tibetan Plateau from 1980 to 2020 is the input of the code, and can be freely replaced.
