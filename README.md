# EQ_NE_TP_-1980to2020-

Two items are included.

1.  We provide the Matlab code to calculate the temporal evolution of b-value by KMS and the imporved KMS.
 
2.  We provided the earthquake data in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from 1980 to 2020.
    The original data include the global earthquakes detected by China seismic network from
    1980 to 2020 and are not publicly open. Request for the original data needs to be sent 
    directly to the China Earthquake Networks Center.
